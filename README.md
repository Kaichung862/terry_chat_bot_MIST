TerryChatBot
TerryChatBot is a Java-based chatbot designed to help students at the Terry College of Business easily discover student organizations that align with their interests, schedules, and goals. By centralizing club information and offering a conversational interface, this tool reduces the time and effort required to find the right organization—and helps students avoid missing important deadlines.

📌 Problem Statement
Many Terry College students struggle to find clubs that match their career goals, schedules, and preferences. Information is often scattered across different websites, and deadlines can be easily missed. TerryChatBot solves this by acting as a centralized, intelligent assistant for student involvement.

A centralized database of all Terry College organizations

A chatbot interface that asks users about:

Career interests

Preferred meeting times

Membership process (e.g., interviews)

MISTERS credit requirements

Personalized recommendations based on user input

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (JDK 17+ recommended)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
